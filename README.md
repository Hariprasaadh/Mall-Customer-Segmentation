# Mall-Customer-Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score, which can help the mall management understand their customers better and devise targeted marketing strategies.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset from Kaggle. It includes the following features:

1. CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to each customer.
2. Gender: Gender of the customer.
3. Age: Age of the customer.
4. Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
5. Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

Results

The K-means clustering algorithm segments customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. Visualizations are provided to help understand the distribution and characteristics of each cluster.
